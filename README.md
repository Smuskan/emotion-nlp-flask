# Emotion Detection Application

This project is a Flask-based web application that uses IBM's Watson NLP library to detect emotions from user-inputted text. It identifies emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, and others, returning them in a structured format. The application is also packaged for ease of use, includes unit tests for reliability, and features error handling and code analysis to ensure robustness and quality.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Leverages Watson NLP to analyze text input and determine the emotions expressed.
- **Flask Web Interface**: Allows users to interact with the application via a simple web interface.
- **Error Handling**: Manages input errors gracefully, ensuring reliability.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive tests to verify functionality and stability.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Achieves a 10/10 pylint score to ensure high-quality code.
